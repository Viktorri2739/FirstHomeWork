        great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No
        one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is
        pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
        rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again
        is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of
        itself, it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in
        which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.<br />
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
        physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has
        any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that
        has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no
